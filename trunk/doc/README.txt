==============================================================================
REQUIREMENTS:
   MolDS requires c/c++ compiler of Intel (icpc) or GNU (g++) and boost-libraries. 
   Valid versions of these compiler are icpc 11.0, g++ 4.4, or later because the
   MolDS is implemented with openMP 3.0. To compile MolDS with g++, furthermore, 
   openBLAS is also required. The default compiler is set as icpc. 

   To get the boost-libraries, see the HP: http://www.boost.org/
   To get the openBLAS-libraries, see the HP: http://xianyi.github.com/OpenBLAS/

==============================================================================
COMPILE(using GNUmake): 
   In the "src" directory in the MolDS package.

   Case i) Using Intel c/c++ compiler (icpc)
      Change the "BOOST_TOP_DIR" in Makefile to the top directory of the 
      boost-libraries in your systems.

      To compile MolDS on 32 bit archtecture,
      $ make depend INTEL=32
      $ make INTEL=32

      To compile MolDS on 64 bit archtecture,
      $ make depend INTEL=64
      $ make INTEL=64

   Case ii) Using GNU c/c++ compiler (g++)
      Change the "BOOST_TOP_DIR" in "Makefile_GNU" to the top directory of the 
      boost-libraries in your systems.
      Change the "OPENBLAS_TOP_DIR" in "Makefile_GNU" to the top directory of the 
      boost-libraries in your systems.
      
      Then, just type: 
      $ make -f Makefile_GNU depend
      $ make -f Makefile_GNU 

   For both case, the compile succeeded if you could fine "MolDS.out" in the "src" directory. 
   Type "$ make clean" when you wanna clean the compilation.

==============================================================================
CARRY OUT MolDS:
   After the compile, in the "src" directory,
   $ ./MolDS.out < input.in
   or
   $ ./MolDS.out input.in

==============================================================================
SAMPLE and TEST
   See files in "test" directories for sample files.
   In the "test" directory, *.in files are input files, then *.dat files are
   associated output files. To execute all test cases, carry out below ruby-script
   in the "test" directory. This script will finished in a few minutes with big
   output(a few thausands lines).

   $ ruby Test_Of_MolDS.rb

   To execute some specific test cases, carry out below ruby-script with the test names you want. 
   When the test names are specifed, ".in" and ".dat" in the arguments will be ignored.

   $ ruby Test_Of_MolDS.rb test1.in test2.dat test3 ...

HOW TO WRITE INPUT:

   <Comment Out>
      Lines starting with "//" or "#" in input-files are treated as comments.

   <SCF>
      Write "cndo/2", "indo", "zindo/s", "mndo", "am1", "am1-d",
      "pm3", "pm3-d", or "pm3/pddg" in theory-directive.
      This theory-directive indicate a electronic structure theory used in your simulations.
      MNDO only supports (can calculate) Heats of formation.
      SCF module outputs also the dipole moment arrond the center of cores of the molecule.
      To calculate the dipole moment, STO-6G [DY_1977] is used.

      E.g. 
         THEORY
            indo 
         THEORY_END
   
      -options
       "max_iter", "rms_density", "damping_thresh", "damping_weight", 
       "diis_num_error_vect", "diis_start_error", "diis_end_error",
       "vdW", "vdW_s6", and "vdW_d" are prepared as options.

       The default value of the "max_iter" is 100.
       The default value of the "rms_density" is 10**(-8.0).
       The default value of the "damping_thresh" is 1.
       The default value of the "damping_weight" is 0.8.
       The default value of the "diis_num_error_vect" is 5.
       The default value of the "diis_start_error" is 0.01.
       The default value of the "diis_end_error" is 10**(-8.0).

       "vdW" should be set as "yes" or "no". 
       When "yes" is set, Grimmes's empirical van der Waals correction([G_2004]) is applied.
       Note that this empirical van der Waals correction is applied to the semiempirical theories 
       of which semiempirical parameters are not modified.
       If user wants to use PM3-D or AM1-D of which semiempirical parameters are modified to be suite for vdW, 
       set theory-directive as "PM3-D" or "AM1-D". 
       When PM3-D or AM1-D is used, users do not need to set "vdW", "vdW_s6", and "vdW_d".
       Generally, PM3-D and AM1-D are recommended for noncovalent complexes 
       than naitive PM3 and AM1 with this empirical vdW, respectively.
       The default value of the "vdW" with the theories except for PM3-D and AM1-D is "no". 
       For PM3-D and AM1-D, this "vdW" is always "yes" whethere user sets or not.

       "vdW_s6" is a scaling factor in the Grimme's van der Waals correction([G_2004]).
       The default value of the "vdW_s6" is 1.4. 
       For PM3-D and AM1-D, this "vdW_s6" is forced to be set as 1.4.

       "vdW_d" is a damping factor in the Grimme's van der Waals correction([G_2004]).
       The default value of the "vdW_d" is 23.0.
       For PM3-D and AM1-D, this "vdW_s6" is forced to be set as 23.0.

       E.g.
         SCF
            max_iter 200
            rms_density 0.00000001
            damping_thresh 0.1
            damping_weight 0.7
            diis_num_error_vect 6
            diis_start_error 0.01

       This option is used only for multisurface RPMD only.
       For the single surface RPMD, this "num_electronic_states" is automatically set to 1.
       The default value of the "num_electronic_states" is 1. 

       "temperature" means the temperature in the RPMD.
       The default value of the "temeprture" is 300[K].

       "type", "origin", "axis", "angle" and "angles" are prepared as options.
       These options are written in rotate-directive. Examples are shown below.

       "type" indicates whether the rotating is carring out around a axis or acording to Euler angles.
       The default value of the "type" is axis.

       "origin" indicates the origin of the rotation in angstrom unit.
       The default value of the "origin" is center of mass.

       "axis" indicates a axis around which the rotation is carried out in angstrom unit.
       The default value of the "axis" is z-axis.
       This option is valid only for "type" set as axis.

       "angle" indicates angle for the rotation around the "axis" in degree unit.
